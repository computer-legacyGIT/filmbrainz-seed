# filmbrainz-seed
Following on from this thread (https://community.metabrainz.org/t/filmbrainz-ideas-thread-i-e-moviebrainz-videobrainz-etc/707370/11) I am creating this repository as a means to record information about various home media releases I own in a semi-structured format so that I can potentially add them later to the project when it is developed.
